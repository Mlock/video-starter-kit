# Status Update: 2024-07-02 15:00

## Progress Made

- Implemented a complete Story Generator feature in the right panel
- Created a step-by-step wizard UI for guided story creation
- Integrated with FAL API for AI-powered content generation:
  - Text generation for story concepts and scene descriptions
  - Image generation for each scene
  - Video generation from images
- Added media storage integration to save generated content to user gallery
- Implemented error handling and user feedback via toast notifications

## New Decisions

- Used a multi-stage generation approach (concept → storyboard → images → videos)
- Added model selection for both image and video generation
- Implemented selective scene generation (users can choose which scenes to convert to video)
- Added common prompt feature to apply the same styling across all videos

## Upcoming Tasks

- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors related to FAL API response types
- [ ] Improve error handling for API failures
- [ ] Add progress indicators for multi-step generation processes
- [ ] Optimize performance for large projects
- [ ] Add option to generate background music for the story

## New Components

- Enhanced the StoryGenerator component in `/src/components/right-panel.tsx`

## Notes

- The feature has TypeScript errors related to the FAL API response structure that need fixing
- The user can choose which AI model to use for both image and video generation
- Multiple video models are supported including Luma Dream Machine, Minimax Video, Kling, Veo 2, and LTX
- The component is accessed via a "Story" button in the left panel

## Next Steps

- Fix TypeScript errors by properly typing the FAL API responses
- Add more fine-grained controls for video generation
- Implement automatic timeline creation from the generated story
- Improve the UX for reviewing and selecting generated content
