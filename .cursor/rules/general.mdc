# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

You will see <ai_context> tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.

If the code is written and it's working, do not rename anything and do not rewrite code files from scratch unless asked to reformat.
